# DocClone
Documentation clones detector based on Colibri-Java library.

### Requirements
Before using this tool you will need to install [Diggit](https://github.com/jrfaller/diggit)
and running it on the desired projet.

### Usage
This tool receives the JSON file generated by [Diggit](https://github.com/jrfaller/diggit) as input,
and returns as output a JSON file containing all the clones detected.

After generating the Jar file all you need to do is to run a command like this :

    java -cp output.jar fr.labri.docclone.App -f <thefile.json>
